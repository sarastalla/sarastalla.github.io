        During the synthesis process, we clustered our findings to
        identify trends across our research, and began to see opportunities emerge.
        These areas focus on service-level offerings and capture distinct
        ways to improve the guest experience.<br><br><br>
      <h5>Creating personalized guest experiences</h5>
      Travelers seek out recommendations to  find the experiences that best suit
      their interests, but not all recommendations are seen as equal.
      There’s opportunity for hotels to offer recommendations to improve the guest
      experience, but <b>keeping those recommendations authentic will be a challenge</b>.<br><br><br>
      <h5>Feeling like a local</h5>
      Many travelers value autonomy, but they also want to feel that they have the
      information and support they need. <b>Travelers appreciate feeling a sense of
      belonging</b>, even when visiting a different country or culture.<br><br><br>
      <h5>Connecting visitors to locals and other visitors</h5>
      Travelers enjoy meeting locals, both through service encounters and chance meetings.
      <b>Unexpected encounters are often the best things about a trip</b>, and hotels can
      design opportunities for people to meet.<br><br>

			<h5>Visioning workshop</h5>
      We designed a structured visioning workshop to transform our research into
      ideas. In preparation, we brainstormed a list of prompts based on our
      opportunity areas, which we then used to guide a series of rapid-fire design sprints.
      We adopted a "yes, and" improv strategy to fill out and collate our favorite ideas,
      and abstracted them into themes we could continue to explore.
      <p>Two concepts really excited
      us: <b>Connecting guests to unique activities</b> and <b>featuring employees as locals and experts</b>.
      We first explored the two concepts separately, imagining how each of them could deliver
      value for guests and employees. Then we began experimenting with ways to combine these
      two concepts in one final design.</p>

      <h5>From ideas to storyboards</h5>
      Next we considered what these themes could look like in context and constructed more refined
      narratives around them. Storyboards are an effective method to both
      explore options among teammates and illustrate to stakeholders how they could play out.
      We began to organize them for presentation to
      our client, loosely binding the ideas to value propositions and
      sample tech implementations. Collectively we strategized to pursue <b>two design directions
      in succession with a series of iterative prototypes: One guest-facing and one staff-facing</b>.

      Low-fidelity prototype
    </div>

    <section class="process">
			<div class="textBox">
          In order to convert our storyboards
          into a successful prototype, we formulated questions we wanted our prototype to answer: e.g.,
          <b>how do travelers assess and choose among a variety of recommendations in the
          context of a digital experience?</b>
          <p>We created wireframes of how the system might look,
        allowing users to choose among staff-recommended activities, personalized
        recommendations, context-aware recommendations, and recommendations drawn
        from other guests’ experiences.</p>
          <p>After mocking up a rough idea of our prototype experience, we came up
            with a research protocol. For the first round of rapid testing, considering
            our time constraints, we determined to recruit a sample of convenience
            from our extended networks: Subjects who were traveling or travel frequently.
            We designed a test that fell somewhere <b>between a thinkaloud and an interview</b>:
            First we would present a scenario, introduce the prototype, ask the research subject
            to guide us through his or her use of the prototype, and finally follow up with
            probing questions for qualitative responses.</p>
            <p>After finalizing our rough paper prototype, we wireframed it in Figma.
              The artifact remained very low-fidelity and captured the character of a paper prototype,
              but we wanted it to be digitized so we could conduct remote interviews.</p>

      Co-creation with hotel staff

			Co-creation is a design strategy that invites stakeholders to participate in
			crafting the experiences that are a part of their lives. In our project, we knew that <b>whatever
      we designed would need to work for staff, fitting into both their work
      lives and their personal desires for interacting with guests</b>.
      To learn what would work best for hotel staff, we conducted a series of
      workshops, each intended to help us learn from the staff how this service
      could work for them.<br><br>

				<h5>First we met with staff and conducted
					interviews to gauge their interest in sharing recommendations.</h5>
				We found that guest-facing staff members genuinely enjoyed sharing and
				connecting with guests and were interested in tools that could make this
				kind of connection easier.<br><br><br>
				<h5>We then ran a co-design session with three staff members to find out
					what they feel comfortable sharing with guests.</h5>
				Our staff content collaboration exercise was both an experience prototype
				and a co-design activity. First the staff members filled out a survey asking
				them questions that would be used to create their profiles.
				Their results went into InDesign mock-ups which were then shown to the staff and used to ideate
				around what kind of content might go into these profiles.<br><br><br>
				<h5>Finally, we asked staff members to supply recommendations and create
					profile content over a five-day diary study in the hotel.</h5>
				This served as a paper prototype for the onboarding process with our system.
				At the end, we were blown away by the quality of the recommendations and the
				eagerness of staff members to provide their own pictures and correct any errors
				in their content.<br>

        Now that we had engaging content provided by the staff members,
        we wanted to see how real users would engage with a higher-fidelity
        prototype in the context of the hotel. The value of testing prototypes in parallel is
        <a class="redUnderline" title="Dow Parallel Prototyping" href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1879836" target="_blank">well</a>
        <a class="redUnderline" title="Tohidi Right Design" href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1124960" target="_blank">documented</a>.
        To that end, we developed two designs for our second round of guest-face prototypes:
        <b>One that focused on featuring staff and one that focused on map-based navigation</b>.
        We tested them with real hotel guests over a 3-day period on-site at
        Tiles Madeira Hotel, seeking to assess the overall strength of the system and identify
        any outstanding user needs and usability issues.

        <p>To conduct these tests, we held “office hours” in the hotel during
          the morning breakfast rush and in the afternoon when
          guest return to the hotel. During these times, one of us
          would set up in either the lobby or the breakfast area and offer guests
          the opportunity to try the prototype. We conducted think-aloud testing
          with a total of 7 guests over the 3-day period. These sessions lasted
          anywhere from 5-45 minutes, and the average session length was 22.5 minutes.</p>
          <p>After the test was completed, we held debrief interviews with staff members
            to get their thoughts on the prototype and to learn about the experience
            of having their content featured.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="textBoxRight">
						<p>Our task prompt was simple:
							“Find something you’re interested in doing.” We found that the staff-featuring prototype,
							which was text-rich and personal, supported <b>lingering over an extended period to discover
							the island’s offerings and employees’ expert preferences</b>.
							When the entry-point was a map, users navigated quickly,
							driven by their <b>personal interest, geographic/scenic appeal,
							and logistics</b>. Users found value in both experiences.
							Furthermore, we confirmed that users find it important to have an <b>artifact</b> to save
							and take with them: We observed our users softly repeating the names of
							recommendations they wanted to remember.</p>

        		<br><br><br>
        		<h5>All three forms of content presentation &mdash; host profiles, a map-based interface,
              and a category-based interface &mdash; were useful to guests</h5>
        		Guest seemed to prefer exploring the profiles and categories
            when looking for something to do, but preferred the map-based
            interface when they already had an idea of what they wanted.
        		<br><br><br>
        		<h5>Some users were skeptical of hotel recommendations,
              but were won over by the personal voices of the staff members</h5>
        		“You can see that it’s honest and that it’s a personal opinion,

            <br><br><br>
        		<h5>It encouraged staff and guest interactions</h5>
        		After testing, one guest said to a reception staff member,

        		As one staff member said, “Sometimes I spend an hour going through options with people.
            Now they can see what I recommend and we can have a nice conversation about what they’re
            interested in doing.”
        		<br><br><br>
        		<h5>Facilitating ownership is hugely important for staff satisfaction</h5>
        		After reviewing their content, several staff members had detailed corrections
            and additions they wanted to make, suggesting a strong desire to shape how their
            content is presented.
        		<br><br><br>
        		<h5>The role of the staff member in the hotel influences how easy
              it is for them to add content</h5>
        		Reception staff, for instance, had more time than restaurant staff to
            dedicate to creating content.
            <br><br><br>
        		<h5>Staff members would love if sharing with guests were a two-way street</h5>
