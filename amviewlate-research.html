				Soneji's design illustrated that many of the limitations experienced
				by people with Parkinson’s disease can be <b>overcome with perceptual tricks</b>.
				While the pace of walking on a flat surface is staggered and interrupted,
				the continuous motion of using a staircase &mdash; or even just the illusion of a staircase &mdash;
				can enable a person with Parkinson’s to walk with a regular gait.

				<p>In order to learn more about this domain, we plunged into a
					literature review of academic journals and news stories. We also reached out to anyone
					in our personal networks who had some knowledge of or experience with Parkinson's disease and was
					available for a guerrilla interview over the phone. Additionally, we generated some preliminary questions
					to help guide our research:
					<ul>
						<li>Is it hard to focus gaze with PD? What are benefits of voice
							vs. gaze control?</li>
						<li>Are there certain surface types or colors that would be better to simulate?</li>
						<li>What are some known methods of providing relief?</li>

		<h5><b>Selected findings</b></h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Some therapists have used <b>tiles or footprints</b> on the ground to improve foot placement
					and widen the patient's base of support.</li>
				<li>While many encounter difficulty extending an arm to interact with an object,
					<b>the introduction of a moving target provides an active stimulus that prompts a response</b>.
					In one video interview, Tom, a 40 year old man suffering from Parkinson's, explained the critical
					advantage of moving targets: "If someone chucked a ball at me, my hand would go straight out.
					And yet if you asked me to put my arm out, it would go so slowly."</li>
				<li>A metronomic pace is effective for maintaining unemcumbered motion;
					researchers have experimented	with consistent visual, auditory, and somatosensory cues
					to coax steady walking. The key is <b>regularity of cadence</b>.</li>
					<li>Festination is a type of shuffled gait in which steps become gradually smaller, faster,
					and less controlled, and often the only way to stop is to crash into an object. Thus it's important
					to keep motion steady, even with natural, <b>intentional interruptions like changing direction</b>.</li>
				<li><b>The color blue</b> may help relieve symptoms of dyskinesia (the impairment of voluntary movement).
					In one study, symptoms in patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease had a tendency to
					worsen in red environments. Wearing a pair of blue glasses or merely
					focusing on a blue subject helped restore steadiness.</li>

		<b>Actionable insights</b>

		<br><br><br>
		<h5>Moving targets are easier to reach</h5>
		Patients have less trouble catching a ball that is tossed to them than picking up a stationary ball.
		<br><br><br>
		<h5>Even with cues, a patient will experience freezing of gait approaching the end of a path</h5>
		Intentional interruptions to a steady pace, like taking a turn, need an element of continuity.
		<br><br><br>
		<h5>The color blue may help relieve symptoms of dyskinesia</h5>
		Looking through a blue plastic sheet or
		glasses with blue lenses may help relieve symptoms of dyskinesia.
