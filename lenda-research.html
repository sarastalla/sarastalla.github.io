				<h5>Travelers to Madeira</h5>
				In order to get a broad look at tourism in Madeira and the needs of
				travelers on the island, we interviewed tourists
				on the street and each spent a day experiencing
				typical tourism activities on the island. From these first-hand
				research activities and reports issued by the Madeira tourism board, we learned that:
				<ul>
				<li>Madeira is seen as an easy getaway for European visitors,
				who come primarily for the natural beauty and weather</li>
				<li>Most visitors come from the UK or Germany, travel as a couple, and stay for at least one week</li>
				<li>Some visitors plan extensively, others play it by ear</li>
				<li>Visitor choose a mix of guided activities and self-guided excursions</li>
				</ul>

			<h5>Interviews with experienced travelers</h5>
			We also conducted interviews to explore the entire travel process,
			from planning through execution through reflection. The interviews were intended to be
			Madeira/island-agnostic, <b>encompassing travel goals and processes</b> more generally.
			We selected people who fit the following profile:
			<ul>
			<li>Frequent and/or recent traveler</li>
			<li>Possess contemporary habits and tastes (e.g., self-guided research,
			comfort with tech and the internet for travel, exemplify the trend of
			“travel” over “tourism”)</li>
			<li>Enjoy a comfort with &mdash; or even affinity for &mdash; new service models (e.g.,
			Airbnb), since those trends are likely to continue</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="textBoxRight">
				<h5>Participatory design workshop</h5>
				After conducting a series of interviews, we embarked on a participatory
				design sprint to validate our research and begin exploring ideas.
				<p>Over the course of two 1-hour sessions, we alternated brainstorming in pairs
					with discussing insights in larger groups. Participants were first asked to engage
					in a <b>directed storytelling exercise</b> about recent trips they had taken,
					paying critical attention to the feelings and motivations
					underlying their actions. Following a quick debrief about what had emerged as noteworthy
					or surprising, the participants were <b>distributed prompts that matched stakeholders to motivations</b>.
					They were then asked to explore how to design for touchpoints in the context of their prompts.</p>

		<h5><b>Insights</b></h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Travelers want the <b>independence that comes with feeling informed</b> about their surroundings</li>
			<li>Knowing the history and <b>idiosyncracies</b> of a place enhances enjoyment</li>
			<li>Travelers seek out locations where they will <b>encounter locals</b></li>
			<li>Travelers often feel skeptical of faceless reviews, but <b>personal
				recommendations</b> are strong motivators</li>
			<li>Minimal planning is done ahead of time; most embark on their trips

						To better understand the hospitality industry in Madeira, we conducted
						two types of research: <b>Competitive analysis</b> of 3-, 4-, and 5-star hotels
						and <b>fly-on-the-wall observations</b> in a subset of these hotels.
						We also asked about accommodations during our interviews with travelers in Madeira.
						<p>To explore guest sentiments, we examined <b>what people said in interviews,
						what they wrote online, and how they navigated hotels’ public spaces</b>.
						These three approaches gave us a multifaceted look at how travelers to
						Madeira think about accommodation.</p>

			Trends in technology

		<section class="process">
			<div class="textBox">
			We conducted service safaris at 5
			hotels to explore the service and tech innovations
			that are being used in Madeira and mainland Europe.
			<p>Many hotels offer custom applications that can connect guests to concierge services,
				allow booking, and offer local tips. The success of these touchpoints was dependent on the
			usability of the touchpoint itself, which varied greatly.
			Frequently, these touchpoints did not work as intended or did not meet
			guest needs (e.g., supporting booking a stay when currently on a trip).
			In these instances, they came across as a “techy” gimmick (one manager described
			his hotel's app as “merely a gadget”). Some tech choices added great value,
			however: <b>Context-aware messages</b> on a digital panel in an elevator
			(“You’re awake, early bird: Check out is not until 10am”) were appreciated,
			and served to softly promote the brand.</p>

			When available, we found <b>interactive panels to be easier to use
			than mobile apps</b>, which required a download, sign up, and lots of nested
			tapping to perform a basic function. Mobile apps were often disappointing:
			Content felt stale and trite, and when promotions were featured,
			it felt like <b>they served the hotels’ interests more than those of the guests</b>.
			In some cases, mobile apps were even destructive to the user experience,
			for reasons including severe bugs, overheating the phone, or requiring a
			vast number of permissions for download. <b>The best apps were those that
			linked to content curated by external professionals</b>, like a local events website.
			Services offered within these mobile apps allow guests to skip communication
			with hotel staff by removing the interaction they would otherwise have had.
			<p>As we approached ideation, we were reminded that
			<b>slapping technology onto a problem is not effective</b>. Much of the technology we
			encountered seemed to be part of the theme of the hotels visited but rarely boosted
			the service quality  &mdash;  we want to avoid solutions that
			“sprinkle some screens” onto the current offerings. Our challenge was
			to find a way to substantially improve the service or allow the hotel
			to offer something new. </p>

			Hotel service innovation

		<section class="process">
			<div class="textBox">
		As we were conducting our research on tech in hotels, we were also
		looking for service innovations that improved the guest experience.
		<p>Each hotel we studied had a unique set of service offerings.
		We grouped innovative services into six categories to explore different
		opportunity spaces. By taking these into consideration, hotels are better
		positioned to provide service for guests at different touchpoints based on
		individual needs and desires.</p>

		<h5>Public spaces</h5>
		Smaller guest rooms lead to more common area spaces where guests can interact
		with each other. There is also opportunity to encourage locals to spend time
		in these areas through service offerings and local events.
		<br><br>
		<h5>Employees as guides</h5>
		Employees act as guides in the digital and physical realm to give guests
		authentic recommendations.
		Employees are trained as experts in recommendations and feel less of a
		hierarchy among staff.
		<br><br>
		<h5>Digital enhancements</h5>
		Through digital screens in rooms guests can create a personalized
		in-room experience, discovering places to visit and things to do.
		<br>
	</div>

	<div class="textBoxRight">
		<h5>Loyalty systems</h5>
		By providing exclusive perks such as a point system or lower priced rooms,
		guests are more inclined to book their stay directly through the hotel.
		This also allows easy tracking of customer data such as habits, preferences, etc.
		<br><br>
		<h5>Events and business</h5>
		More space dedicated to event or meeting areas enables additional revenue
		through conference room rentals and catering services.
		<br><br>
		<h5>A la carte offerings</h5>
		Guests opt to pay for what they want instead of having all amenities included.
		Additional items include breakfast, on-demand video, etc.

		<b>Research synthesis</b>

		<br><br><br>
		<h5>Authenticity is a priority</h5>
		While often intangible, authenticity is easy to detect; as one traveler
		put it, “the details need to match up.”
		<br><br><br>
		<h5>Small encounters are delightful</h5>
		Casual, serendipitous run-ins feel personal and memorable,
		and are often some of the most fondly-remembered parts of a trip.
		<br><br><br>
		<h5>Guests want help with logistics</h5>
		Although travelers vary in how much they plan ahead, most arrive with
		some idea of what they want to do, but are eager for help in figuring
		out how to do these things.
		<br><br><br>
		<h5>Information you can trust comes from real people</h5>
		Travelers rely on the contextual information around a recommendation &mdash; stories,
		photographs, anecdotal tidbits &mdash; to assess whether a given activity is right for them.
